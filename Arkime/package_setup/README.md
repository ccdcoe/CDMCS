# Setting up from deb package

## Install Arkime package

Download arkime package from [the official download page](https://arkime.com/downloads) and install it with your package manager.

```
dpkg -i arkime_5.1.2-1.ubuntu2204_amd64.deb
```

On debian/ubuntu, this will fail.

```

```

That's okay, it's just missing some dependencies. Dependency manager should take care of it.

```
apt-get -f install
```

Arkime is now installed in `/opt`.

```
cd /opt/arkime
```

## Get elasticsearch up and running

Set up elasticsearch.

```
docker run -ti -d --name arkime-elastic -v elastic_data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data:rw -p 127.0.0.1:9200:9200 -e "discovery.type=single-node" -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" --restart unless-stopped docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.13.4
```

Verify that elastic is up and running. You can check logs...

```
docker logs arkime-elastic --follow
```

...or interact with elastic API.

```
student@student-linux:~$ curl -ss http://localhost:9200
{
  "name" : "43194d1deb40",
  "cluster_name" : "docker-cluster",
  "cluster_uuid" : "lWs_x9FMSNKgd3V2AcDipA",

}
```

Some important endpoints to keep tabs on.

```
/_cat/indices
/_cat/shards
/_cat/health
```

## Initialize elastic database

Before configuring, let's take care of setting up the database. Enter the `db` directory.

```
cd /opt/arkime/db
```

And call the database management script.

```
student@student-linux:/opt/arkime/db$ ./db.pl localhost:9200 init
It is STRONGLY recommended that you stop ALL Arkime captures and viewers before proceeding.  Use 'db.pl http://localhost:9200 backup' to backup db first.

There is 1 elastic search data node, if you expect more please fix first before proceeding.

This is a fresh Arkime install

Finished
```

Verify the elastic indices.

## Set up WISE

WISE stands for `With Intelligence See Everything`. It's a nodejs service that complements arkime capture and viewer. While it's non-essential, it should nevertheless be set up first. Capture and Viewer will attempt to connect to WISE if configured to use it. They will fail if WISE is not already up and running.

Firstly, set up the WISE config file.

```
cp /opt/arkime/etc/wise.ini.sample /opt/arkime/etc/wise.ini
```

Edit the config file in `/opt/arkime/etc/wise.ini`. Firstly, enable the `reversedns` module.

```
[reversedns]
ips=10.0.0.0/8
field=asset
```

Secondly, we can create a custom source to enrich some data types. For example, we can define information about IP addresses in a text file to enrich our NDR info. That info can be asset enrichment to translate addresses into human-readable names. Or it can be a threat intel feed to mark on IoC-s.

```
[file:ip]
file=/opt/arkime/etc/ip-data.txt
tags=ipwise
type=ip
format=tagger
```

Then create the corresponding file `/opt/arkime/etc/ip-data.txt`. Note the initial *commented* lines. These are not comments! They define custom fields that are used. WISE is simply a API that capture will query before saving the session in Elasticsearch. Viewer also uses WISE to inject new functionality into viewer code.

**Note that this will not work until custom fields are created by capture.** Go to *cool tricks* section at the end to see how to do that.

```
#field:cdmcs.name;shortcut:0
#field:cdmcs.type;shortcut:1
192.168.56.11;0=local
10.0.2.15;0=local
8.8.8.8;0=google;1=dns
8.8.4.4;0=google;1=dns
1.1.1.1;0=cloudflare;1=dns
66.6.32.31;0=tumblr;1=web
66.6.33.31;0=tumblr;1=web
66.6.33.159;0=tumblr;1=web
```

Go to `wiseService` folder. Since it's a nodejs app, everything needs to be executed from that root path.

```
cd /opt/arkime/wiseService
```

Then test that configuration works by executing WISE on command line.

```
root@setup:/opt/arkime/wiseService# /opt/arkime/bin/node wiseService.js -c /opt/arkime/etc/wise.ini

[[20:03:08.496]] [LOG]   Express server listening on port 8081 in development mode
```

If all seems well, exit the foreground program and set up a systemd service. Add following content to `/etc/systemd/system/arkime-wise.service`.

```
[Unit]
Description=arkime WISE
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
ExecStart=/opt/arkime/bin/node wiseService.js -c /opt/arkime/etc/wise.ini
WorkingDirectory=/opt/arkime/wiseService
SyslogIdentifier=arkime-wise

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Systemd needs a refresh after units are added or changed.

```
systemctl daemon-reload
```

Then start and enable the service.

```
systemctl enable arkime-wise.service
systemctl start arkime-wise.service
systemctl status arkime-wise.service
```

Observe that output is something like this.

```

```

## Set up Capture

Capture is a tcpdump-like program written in C. It writes raw packets into pcap files on disk and stores session metadata in elasticsearch. It also stores the offset of every packet for a session on disk, which will later allow viewer to reconstruct full packet stream whenever a session is expanded.

Firstly, call geoip update script to pull some files. Capture will not start if those files are missing.

```
root@setup:/opt/arkime# /opt/arkime/bin/arkime_update_geo.sh
2022-06-07 20:15:19 URL:https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space/ipv4-address-space.csv [23331/23331] -> "/tmp/tmp.FUDuons64v" [1]
2022-06-07 20:15:19 URL:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wireshark/wireshark/master/manuf [2004683/2004683] -> "/tmp/tmp.XRkZ70f7VI" [1]
```

Create a folder with correct permissions to store pcap files. If you choose another folder, make sure it's reflected in config.

```
mkdir /opt/arkime/raw
chown nobody:daemon /opt/arkime/raw/
```


All configuration is in `/opt/arkime/etc/config.ini`. That needs to be set up. **Do not add new options at the end of the file**. Arkime supports multi-capture / multi-viewer setup that share a config file. So adding a option at the end means configuring another node section and it would never apply on the default one.

```
cp /opt/arkime/etc/config.ini.sample /opt/arkime/etc/config.ini
```

Replace the placeholder for arkime install path.

```
sed -i "s/ARKIME_INSTALL_DIR/\/opt\/arkime/g" /opt/arkime/etc/config.ini
```

Point arkime to elasticsearch.

`elasticsearch=http://localhost:9200`

Set a **random** passphrase. This is a secret value used to encrypt user passwords in database. So just roll your hands over the keyboard.

`passwordSecret = <somethingveryrandom>`

Insert a semicolon separated list of interfaces to sniff on. Use `ip link show` to find your system interfaces.

`interface=eth0;eth1`

WISE can be set up by importing a capture module and pointing capture to the service.

```
wiseHost=127.0.0.1
```

```
plugins=wise.so
```

Then test the capture service.

```
/opt/arkime/bin/capture -c /opt/arkime/etc/config.ini
```

Then check the elastic to verify that `arkime_sessions3-*` exists.

```

And make sure we have pcap on disk.

```
root@setup:/opt/arkime# ls -lah /opt/arkime/raw/

```

Then set up a systemd service.

```

## Set up viewer

Arkime viewer is a nodejs service that provides the hunting interface. 

It shares its config file with capture, meaning most parameters should already be set up if you have capture running. Some parameters are only used by capture, others only by viewer. For example, WISE plugin needs to be loaded with different config parameter than capture. URL, however, is shared with capture.

```
# Semicolon ';' seperated list of viewer plugins to load and the order to load in
viewerPlugins=wise.js
```

Like WISE, everything needs to be executed in `viewer` folder.

```
cd /opt/arkime/viewer
```

Web interface needs a user. We can create one with provided viewer script. Note that if you ever reconfigure `passwordSecret`, then user also needs to be updated as the password is encrypted with that secret.

```
/opt/arkime/bin/node addUser.js -c /opt/arkime/etc/config.ini owl owl owlpass --admin
```

Then test out running the viewer.

```
/opt/arkime/bin/node viewer.js -c /opt/arkime/etc/config.ini
```

And finally set up systemd service.

```

## Adding JA4+ support

JA3 is a TLS fingerprinting technique that has become an industry standard. It is essentially a MD5 hash of TLS client or server HELLO packet. I.e., before TLS client and server can actually establish encrypted communications, they need to exchange cyper suites in order to agree on common encryption algorithms that both sides support. This is a sequence of numbers, and JA3 is basically just a hash of that sequence.

Since 2023, Google Chrome started randomizing the order in which extensions are issued. This is called [TLS ClientHello Extension Permutation](https://www.stamus-networks.com/blog/ja3-fingerprints-fade-browsers-embrace-tls-extension-randomization), and it effectively killed JA3 fingerprinting. Sequence of these numbers is now random and thus produces a different hash every time.

In order to deal with this problem, NSM tools are migrating to JA4 hashing, which is really a suite of fingerprinting techniques not only for TLS clients and servers, but also for HTTP, SSH, TCP, etc. Among other things, JA4 is also more resilient against randomization. But JA4 has another major issue which prevents open-source tools from simply incorporating it. JA4 for client and QUIC are released under BSD licence, but others are sold with commercial licence instead. [These other fingerprinting techniques, referred to as JA4+, can not be used for monetization](https://github.com/FoxIO-LLC/ja4#licensing), so open-source tools could easily get into trouble by including them.

Arkime gets around that by providing compiled ja4 plugin that can then be set up by the users themselves. It is quite simple, a shared object (`.so`) file needs to be placed into `plugins` folder and then enabled as capture plugin.

## Cont3xt

[Cont3xt](https://arkime.com/cont3xt) is a new tool in the Arkime family. It's been around since version 4 but has been improved in v5. It is a nodejs web application that condenses indicator lookups to a single interface. For example, instead of having different browser tabs open for virustotal, shotad, etc, one simply queries the indicator (domain, IP, hash, email, etc) from cont3xt instead. In the backend, cont3xt queries different services for you and then presents condensed info on a single screen.

* https://arkime.com/cont3xt#install

Note, this guide sets up default cont3xt systemd service which logs to plaintext file under `/opt/arkime/logs` folder. If following this tutorial, that folder might be missing and service would fail. Make sure the folder exists before restarting the service.

## Cool tricks

Arkime is not limited to fields defined by its creators. You can add your own!

You can override fields in `config.ini` using the `[override-ips]` section. This works per subnet. Note that country is limited only to 2 chars. This is a really useful trick in exercises where networks are simulated anyway.

* https://arkime.com/taggerformat

```
[override-ips]
192.168.56.0/24=tag:private-net;country:BY;rir:SINET;asn:AS0000 This is neat
10.0.2.0/24=tag:private-net;country:CR;rir:SINET;asn:AS0000 This is neat
```

You can define new fields in `config.ini`. Note that this can also be done in WISE plugin setup but is much cleaner in main config file. Very useful for instant asset documentation. If you have a API to pull asset data from, generate some WISE data!

* https://arkime.com/settings#custom-fields

```
[custom-fields]
target.name=kind:lotermfield;count:true;friendly:Name;db:target.name;help:Target name
cdmcs.name=kind:lotermfield;count:true;friendly:Name;db:cdmcs.name;help:Traffic owner
cdmcs.type=kind:lotermfield;count:true;friendly:Type;db:cdmcs.type;help:Traffic type
```

New fields are better when visible for related sessions. Again, this can be done with other (more painful) methods, but this is the cleanest.

* https://arkime.com/settings#custom-views

```
[custom-views]
cdmcs=title:Cyber Defence Monitoring Course;require:cdmcs;fields:cdmcs.name,cdmcs.type
```

Arkime can define rules.

* https://arkime.com/rulesformat
* https://arkime.com/rules

In `config.ini` -

```
rulesFiles=/opt/arkime/etc/rules.conf
```

Then individual rules files look like this.

```
version: 1
rules:
  - name: "Drop tls"
    when: "fieldSet"
    fields:
      protocols:
      - tls
    ops:
      _maxPacketsToSave: 12
```

    "   * Final index pattern should look like `suricata-<event_type>-<YEAR>.<MONTH>.<DAY>.<HOUR>`\n",

    "   * Verify by writing a wildcard query for pattern `suricata-dns-2019.*`\n",
    " * Everyone usually uses logstash to do this stuff, some tools assume this and look for logstash-specific fields when running queries;\n",
    "   * Fix one future issue by adding a new field `@timestamp` to each document. It should correspond to `timestamp` field from EVE log;"

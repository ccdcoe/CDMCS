# Course intro

## Course background

* Designed as hands-on classroom course
* *from techies for techies*
* Historically very free-flowing
* No slides, only markdown, Vagrantfiles and instructors in classroom
* Tentative timeline, *grab coffee when you need it*, rearranging topics
* Make students go through painful troubleshooting on purpose!
    * You don't store this knowledge from listening to lectures or copy-pasting commands

## Taking it remote

* 6x3h sessions
* spread out over 2 weeks
* to avoid burnout
* shortened format
* timeline is still tentative

## TODO

* Teaching Suricata (well, duh)
* Back to basics, cut some tricky stuff
  * log shipping, group work, etc
* Focus on core Suricata on week 1
  * rules, EVE, replay, rulesets, malware pcap explore
* Advanced topics on week 2
  * building, config, datasets, lua, elastic
* Rules, rulesets, JSON logs, replay

## Goal / Important notes

* Passing on our knowledge
    * But we are not full-time teachers
* Everyone takes something home
* Open materials, repeatable environments
* No Powerpoint, only markdown and git
* Materials are in ArchLinux Wiki style!

This material has been designed to be taught in a [classroom](https://ccdcoe.org/training/cyber-defence-monitoring-course-module-1/) environment... hands-on 80% + talk 40% + **slides 0%** = 120% hard work 

**The material is missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.**

This is material for any intermediate-level dev-ops who has some experience with other security|monitoring tools and wants to learn Suricata. We believe these classes are perfect for anyone who wants a jump start in learning Suricata or who wants a more thorough understanding of it internals.

> Suricata is a free and open source, mature, fast and robust network threat detection engine. The Suricata engine is capable of real time intrusion detection (IDS), inline intrusion prevention (IPS), network security monitoring (NSM) and offline pcap processing.
